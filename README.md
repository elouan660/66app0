# 66app0
This program can be used to learn some vocabulary
You have to create a text file, into this file you have to write your words like this:

`
word1:word2 \n
|word3:word4 \n
|word5:word6 \n
...
`

On the left side a langage and on the other side the other langage
You don't have to write "\n", it is just a carriage return
The only file you have to download is "66app0.py", others files are containing the vocabulary I am learning in class, you can however test them.
